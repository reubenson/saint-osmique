        <h2>A bit about me ...</h2>
<p>First, I’d like to thank you for your interest in Saint-Osmique! I am delighted to share with you my passion for the world of perfumery. As a dedicated connoisseur in this art form, I find much joy in unraveling the intricacies of scents, and I am eager to guide you through the mesmerizing journey of fragrance exploration.</p>
<p>Growing up in a family of artists and psychologists in Switzerland, I was exposed to a unique blend of creativity and analytical thinking from an early age. These two worlds seamlessly intertwined in my life, leading me to discover the profound impact scents can have on our emotions, memories, and well-being. It became clear to me that perfumery encapsulates the essence of both artistry and psychology, making it the perfect playground for my endeavors.</p>
<p>My family's artistic background fostered an appreciation for beauty, aesthetics, and the power of self-expression. It nurtured my ability to perceive and appreciate compositions that evoke a plethora of emotions, whether in the world of scent, visual arts or music. Harnessing my artistic sensibilities, I channel these influences into my work as a fragrance concierge.</p>
<p>In parallel, my family's psychological expertise provided me with invaluable insights into the intricate workings of the human mind. Understanding the profound connection between scent and emotion, I delved deep into the psychological impact of fragrances, unearthing their ability to evoke and influence moods and memories. This knowledge –stemming from analysis, empathy and empirical observation– enables me to understand which scents resonate with my clients on a profound level, tapping into their unique history and experience.</p>

<p>My journey as a fragrance concierge has been a dynamic exploration of sensory experiences, cultural influences, and artistic discoveries. I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed fragrance retailers, built relationships with talented perfumers, and conducted extensive research into what is available to smell in NYC. Each step has honed my skills, deepened my understanding, and further ignited my passion for the art of perfumery.</p>
<p>Through this platform, I aspire to share my expertise, offering guidance, insights, and inspiration to anyone curious about the captivating world of fragrance. Whether you seek to enhance your personal collection, find your own signature scent, or understand the intricate nuances of perfumery, I am here to guide you on this scented tapestry, weaving together art, psychology, and the mesmerizing power of scent.</p>
<p>Osmically yours,</p>
<p>David</p>
