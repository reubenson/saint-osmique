      <h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>First, set up an <a href="/contact">appointment</a>. I will meet you in person at a time and place that is most convenient for you, either in Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens*. During this first meeting we will discuss what it is you’re looking for as well as your general experience with and understanding of fragrance. Samples and a questionnaire will be provided to help guide you through the process. This consultation generally takes about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Then, I will set out to collect six samples of scents I believe are best for you, based on the information gathered during the first meeting. This search usually takes about a week. Once the samples have been collected, we will arrange a second meeting where I will assist you in a preliminary round of testing. The samples will be numbered and unbranded as to not steer your judgement. You will get to keep them.</p>
<p>You will then be given a week to continue testing the scents “blindly” after which I will reveal the names, brands, prices and stockists of each sampled fragrances should you elect to purchase any of them. I can act as a personal shopper and get you whichever fragrances you wish to buy for a small fee. Additional rounds of search may be ordered as well.</p>
<p>Price: $300 — includes both meetings and 1st round of search</p>

<p>*Somewhere quiet and familiar is to be preferred.</p>
